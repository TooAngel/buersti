- Resistor before LED: Reduce current (https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/resistor-before-or-after-led/)
- Capacitor at power supply: Preventing voltage spikes?
  - The power supply consists of the electrolytic
capacitor C1 that smoothes the supply voltage (which is very important because the 3 DC motors are
all operated with PWM)

  - I think the factor of the lawn mower is wrong
- How does the collison control work? (page 159)

- brush motor:
  - schottky diode
  - transistor?
  - resitor
  - motor
  - do I need to change anything if I change the motor?
